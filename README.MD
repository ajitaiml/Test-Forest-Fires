# üî• Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction

A production-ready machine learning web application built with **Flask**, designed to predict the **Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI)** based on meteorological inputs. This project demonstrates a full ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

---

## üìå Overview

Forest fires pose a severe environmental threat. Predicting the **FWI** helps in early warning and proactive measures. This application accepts key environmental features and predicts the FWI using a **Ridge Regression model** trained on historical data.
